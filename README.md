## MIPI D-PHY Background

The MIPI D-PHY (Display Physical Layer) is a specification developed by the MIPI Alliance that defines a high-speed serial interface physical layer. It operates in two primary modes:

- **High-Speed (HS) Mode**: Differential signaling for high data rates (80 Mbps to 2.5 Gbps per lane)
- **Low-Power (LP) Mode**: Single-ended signaling for control and low-speed data transmission

The D-PHY typically consists of:
- One clock lane (differential pair)
- One to four data lanes (differential pairs each)
- Bidirectional communication capability
- Power-efficient design optimized for battery-powered devices
