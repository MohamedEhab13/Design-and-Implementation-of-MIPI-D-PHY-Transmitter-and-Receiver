# Design and Implementation of MIPI D-PHY Transmitter and Receiver

## Overview

This project presents a design and implementation of a MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) D-PHY transmitter and receiver system. The D-PHY specification defines the physical layer for high-speed serial interfaces commonly used in mobile and embedded systems for camera sensor interfaces, display connections, and other high-bandwidth applications.

## MIPI D-PHY Background

The MIPI D-PHY (Display Physical Layer) is a specification developed by the MIPI Alliance that defines a high-speed serial interface physical layer. It operates in two primary modes:

- **High-Speed (HS) Mode**: Differential signaling for high data rates
- **Low-Power (LP) Mode**: Single-ended signaling for control and low-speed data transmission

The D-PHY typically consists of clock and data lanes operating as differential pairs, with bidirectional communication capability and power-efficient design optimized for battery-powered devices.

## Implementation Details

Based on the RTL implementation, this project includes the following key components:

### Transmitter Components
- **MIPI TX**: Main transmitter module handling data transmission
- **MIPI TX Controller**: Control logic for transmission operations
- **TX Clock Management**: Clock generation and distribution for transmitter
- **Serial Data Transmission**: Conversion of parallel data to serial format

### Receiver Components  
- **MIPI RX**: Main receiver module for data reception
- **MIPI RX Controller**: Control logic for reception operations
- **RX Clock Management**: Clock recovery and distribution for receiver
- **Serial Data Reception**: Conversion of serial data back to parallel format

### Core Features
